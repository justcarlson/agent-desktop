# Capture and Clipboard on Linux

X11 needs no permission and no outside tool. Wayland asks a person once for
`screenshot` and needs `wl-clipboard`. `agent-desktop permissions` shows the
case: `screen_recording` is `not_required` on X11 and `unknown` on Wayland.
`screenshot` has no timeout flag.

## `screenshot` on X11

```bash
agent-desktop screenshot --app gnome-calculator /tmp/calc.png
agent-desktop screenshot --screen 0 /tmp/screen0.png
agent-desktop screenshot /tmp/everything.png
```

- No permission and no prompt. Targets: a window (`--app`, `--window-id`), a
  display by `list-displays` index (`--screen`), or with no selector the primary
  display (the first if none is marked primary). With no output path the image
  returns as base64 in `data`.
- A window is read from its own drawable. Under a compositing window manager
  (mutter) covered and minimized windows are captured (each measured 360x504
  with a 900x700 editor over the calculator).
- Under a non-compositing window manager (openbox) that read is not possible. A
  covered window answers `ACTION_FAILED` with `details.reason: "covered"` and
  the suggestion to raise it with `--headed focus-window`; the same capture
  after the focus returns the window. A minimized window answers `INVALID_ARGS`
  ("The window is not viewable and the window manager does not composite, so it
  has no pixels to capture") with the suggestion to `restore` it. Both are
  `not_delivered` and `retry: safe`. On a non-compositing manager, whole-screen
  and `--screen` captures are exact (1280x800 on the measured display).
- Under a compositor such as GNOME on X11 the root window holds only the
  manager's own stage, so whole-screen and `--screen` captures answer
  `PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED` with `details.reason: "compositing"` and the
  suggestion to capture one window with `--window-id`. The area no X window owns
  (wallpaper, shell chrome) cannot be read under a compositor.
- Two windows of one process with the same title: `--window-id` captures the one
  the toolkit reports active, and its twin when exactly two windows share the
  title. Any other tie answers `AMBIGUOUS_TARGET` ("More than one X11 window
  matches this window") with `candidates` and the suggestion to give the windows
  distinct titles.
- The tool hides its own cursor overlays during capture and restores them; they
  neither block the screenshot nor appear in its pixels.
- A display-server or caller-deadline timeout stays `TIMEOUT`, including when
  capturing a covered window. It does not prove coverage or advise focus.
- Redirected capture preserves resource, connection and visibility failures;
  only unproven window paint receives the `covered` advice.

## `screenshot` on Wayland

Wayland has no window position and no per-window capture. The portal's
`Screenshot` captures the desktop; the CLI returns the primary display by
default, cropping the image on a multi-monitor desktop. `--screen N` selects
another monitor.

```bash
agent-desktop screenshot /tmp/desktop.png
```

- The first call shows a consent dialog ("Allow Applications to Take
  Screenshots?", Deny focused) that is not on the accessibility bus. A person
  must answer it. The CLI waits for the portal's answer, bounded by the longer
  of the command's own budget and 30 s.
- Allow returns the selected display as a PNG. Deny, or a dismissed dialog,
  gives `PERM_DENIED`.
- Nobody answers: the portal gives up after about 25 s (measured 25.0 s twice)
  and the call returns `TIMEOUT`, with the dialog named in its suggestion. The
  dialog stays open, and later calls return `PERM_DENIED` at once, with no
  second dialog, until a person dismisses it. Do not retry in a loop: ask the
  user to answer it.
- The desktop remembers the answer per user for the host process. After Allow,
  later calls return in about 50 ms with no dialog. After Deny, every call is
  `PERM_DENIED` until the user resets it in the desktop's privacy settings.
- `--screen N` and a display target crop the whole-desktop image to that
  monitor. Cropping requires dimensions that confirm the monitor layout;
  otherwise the call answers `PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED` with reason
  `display_mapping`.
- A known display layout is rechecked after consent, including when it had only
  one monitor. A changed layout returns `ACTION_FAILED` without pixels.
- A window target (`--app`, `--window-id`) is `PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED` on
  Wayland, permanently. Capture a display, or read the window with `snapshot`.
- The portal writes the PNG under the user's home. The CLI accepts the file only
  inside the temp, runtime or home directory, checks it is a regular file of the
  user made for this request, reads it and removes it.

## Clipboard

```bash
agent-desktop clipboard-set "hello from agent-desktop"
agent-desktop clipboard-get
agent-desktop clipboard-clear
```

`clipboard-get` reads `text` by default; `--format` takes `auto`, `image` or
`file-urls`. `clipboard-set` takes text, `--image <png>` or `--file-url <path>`.
Image content is written to a private file (`--out` picks the path) and the
result carries its `path`, `width` and `height`. An empty clipboard answers
`found: false`.

### X11

- `clipboard-set` hands the selection to a detached owner process, the helper
  `agent-desktop-linux-clipboard-owner`, which serves the content until another
  client takes the selection or `clipboard-clear` ends it. The CLI exits first;
  the content stays available while the owner lives.
- The helper must sit beside the `agent-desktop` binary and be a regular
  executable file, not a symlink, owned by the user or root. Neither it nor its
  directory may be writable by a shared group; the file must not be
  world-writable. A group-writable helper is accepted when its group is the
  user's own private group. A world-writable directory is accepted only with the
  sticky bit. A 777 copy is refused with `PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED`, "writable by
  others". npm installs and release archives ship it in place. A binary copied
  alone cannot set the clipboard: `PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED` names the missing
  helper. Both refusals are `not_delivered`, `safe`.
- Without a clipboard manager the content ends with the owner. GNOME's shell
  keeps only text and PNG after the owner dies, caps text at 4 MiB, and does not
  take over a file copy or a custom target: do not rely on content outliving the
  owner.
- A file copy serves `x-special/gnome-copied-files` and `text/uri-list`. A
  plain-text path pastes nothing in a file manager.
- Transfers above the server's single-request limit (262140 bytes measured) use
  `INCR`; large content works.
- "Nothing there" and "target not available" are different answers: an absent
  format is `absent`, not an error.

### Wayland

- The clipboard goes through `wl-clipboard` (`wl-copy`, `wl-paste`): install the
  package. Text, images and file lists round-trip against foreign readers and
  writers under GNOME. `clipboard-clear` runs `wl-copy --clear`.
- Routing follows the display-server detector: an empty `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` counts
  as unset, and a stale socket falls through to a reachable `DISPLAY`. Once
  Wayland is selected, clipboard failures never fall back to X11. A missing
  `wl-copy` or `wl-paste` returns `PLATFORM_NOT_SUPPORTED` with a `wl-clipboard`
  install hint, even when `DISPLAY` is set.
- After Wayland is selected, a failed connection ("Failed to connect to a
  Wayland server"), a seat with no keyboard ("This seat has no keyboard") and a
  timeout from a shell that has stopped serving clients are distinct errors,
  never an empty clipboard.

### Clipboard through FFI

The C library reaches the same code; its clipboard API is text-only. Set and
clear take the cross-process interaction lease; reads have a deadline but do not
take that mutation lease. The matching owner helper can sit beside
`libagent_desktop_ffi.so`; it need not sit beside the host's executable. There
is no stable SONAME yet.
